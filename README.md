# ClassAct - Class file parser

This is most likely not the class library you are looking for.

https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy and https://asm.ow2.io/ are probably better suited to your needs.

Still here? Then maybe you do want a JDK8 compatible class library that supports right up to the latest Java version :)
